# Beginner-Movie-Recommendation-System-Content-Based-Filtering-

Project Overview:
In this project, I built a simple movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on the content of a user's favorite movie.

What I Did:

Collected data about movies — including genres, cast, director, keywords, and taglines.

 Cleaned and combined these details into one text format for each movie.

 Converted the movie details into numbers using TF-IDF Vectorizer (a method from Natural Language Processing).

Measured how similar two movies are using Cosine Similarity.

Allowed users to type any movie name, and the system recommends the most similar movies.


Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Difflib, TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity

Why it's cool:
This is a beginner-friendly project that shows how machine learning and text processing can be used to build a Netflix-style recommendation system — without using any complex deep learning!
